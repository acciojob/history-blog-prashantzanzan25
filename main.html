    <h1>History</h1>

	<h2><b>Main Articles</b>: History of Blogging and Online Diary</h2>
	
	<p>An early example of a "diary" style blog consisting of text and images transmitted wirelessly in real-time from a wearable computer with head-up display, February 22, 1995. The term <b>"weblog"</b> was coined by Jorn Barger[13] on December 17, 1997. The short form, <b>"blog"</b>, was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase <b>we blog</b> in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999. Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used <b>"blog"</b> as both a noun and verb ("<b>to blog</b>", meaning "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term <b>"blogger"</b> in connection with Pyra Labs Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms[17].</p>
